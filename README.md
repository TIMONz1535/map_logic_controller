# Map Logic Controller - Lua Inputs/Outputs

**Map Logic Controller** (short `MapLogic`) allows you to setup the Inputs/Outputs logic on map from Lua.
If you don't understand what I'm talking about, please refer to the official documentation [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Inputs_and_Outputs).

The controller is a server-side *point* entity, which makes it possible to create outputs in Lua scripts for map entities.
Thanks to this, you can easily configure the complex logic of mechanisms, elevators, doors, combination locks, trains - everything that in **Hammer** turns into a living hell of dozens of logic entities, millions of outputs, and is often an impossible task.


# Use cases

In general, with this addon, you can easily create logical things that are too cumbersome in **Hammer**. Elevator from *func_tracktrain* for 5 floors? Easy! As usual, create an elevator, its path from *path_track*, 5 buttons in the elevator and each on the floor. Give them all a name, you don't need anything else in **Hammer**. Now just get these entities in the code, and write all logic in Lua - add the necessary outputs and call the inputs via `Entity:Fire` to open the doors and start/stop the elevator. You don't even need to setup the sounds in **Hammer**, because they can be played directly from Lua!

For RP maps, you can, for example, private buttons for certain jobs. You can setup the logic for different gamemodes, events, weathers or seasons, and switch them using `map_logic_override`. You can change or fix the logic on existing maps if you rename the necessary entities - this will completely mute the inputs. However, this will not work on outputs with [Keywords](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Targetname#Keywords) `!activator`, `!self`, `!player`. **There is no way to remove an output from the entity [#1984](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-requests/issues/1984). Alternatively, you can mute them all via `GM:AcceptInput`.**

For a coop-maps or a story-maps, you can setup the NPC spawn logic, control waves of enemies and the spawn of bosses. Launch complex scenes by triggers and buttons, give players ammunition and weapons without ugly manipulations with **Hammer** entities! You can easily use all advantages of Lua, create timers, logical if else, switch-case, mathematical operations, calculating integrals, getting computer time... The possibilities of using this addon are limited only by your imagination.


# Security recommendations

It is important to understand that I am not responsible for the scripts that people make for their maps. This entity **is not** an alternative to `lua_run`, it **does't execute code** and is not created from **Hammer**. This entity is designed to give easy control over the map logic from Lua scripts, but everything that the script author will write is on his conscience.

On Lua you can do anything, starting from simple prank, ending with major security things. Do not try to create secret buttons that give some goods or admin-access to player. This is similar to what if you used `lua_run` for fun, don't do that! **Please note that it is bad form to check access to secret rooms by SteamID. Please do not kick or ban players on your maps, this is a very bad thing.**


# For developers and server owners

The controller is created at the map start, the logic is initialized by run the `OnMapLogicInitialized` hook. Developers can put their `.lua` scripts in an addon with a map or a separate addon.

* Console command `map_logic_reload` - Removes the old controller and creates a new one. Forces the entire map logic to be initialized again. Please don't use this [too many times](https://github.com/TIMONz1535/map_logic_controller/wiki#a-few-simple-rules).

* Console variable `map_logic_override ""` - Overrides map name for which the controller will initialize the logic. This way, you can make several presets for one map. The value of the variable is not saved, so you need to set it when the server starts in `autoexec.cfg` or `server.cfg`.
